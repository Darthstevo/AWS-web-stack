# AWS-web-stack
Setting up a simple redundant website

# Purpose
Getting hands on with AWS services.

The infrastructure design for this is to have a reliable and fail proof/redundant web stack..


Going by the 5 Pillars of a well-Architected framework;


* Operational Excellence: Plans to automate in the future. have a “2-way door” decision, look at failures and remove them.

* Security: Create users with least privilege, separate duties, enable traceability by monitoring and alerting. Apply security at all layers. Plan for security events.

* Reliability: Test recovery plans, simulate issues, automatically recover plans. Loose coupled resources.

* Performance Efficiency:Stay up to date with technologies and plan for expertise guidance. Go global in minutes. Avoid managing servers, operate at cloud scale. Experiment more often.

* Cost Optimization:  Pay only for what you use. Measure business output and cost. Don't spend money on data center operations and focus on customers and business. Look into Managed services to remove the cost of ownership.
