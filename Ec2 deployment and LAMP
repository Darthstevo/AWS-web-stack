First thing to do is starting with a web server t2 micro something low cost or free.
All free tier defaults, during set up in “Advance details” enter your boot-strap script aka the LAMP stack install so it can be done during instance creation.

# Copy paste boot-strap or “bash” script here (up to date 10/2020);


#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install httpd php php-mysql -y
amazon-linux-extras install php7.4
cd /var/www/html 
wget https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.5.1.tar.gz
tar -xzf wordpress-5.5.1.tar.gz
cp -r wordpress/* /var/www/html/
rm -rf wordpress
rm -rf wordpress-5.5.1.tar.gz
chmod -R 755 wp-content
chown -R apache:apache wp-content
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on


Pro tip: (Remember to install the most up to date php and wordpress.. Or you will have a couple of wacky issues during the site configuration) 

This install and configuration sets up LAMP and moves all wordpress to the /var/www/html directory

Changes the ownership and group to apache for wp-content file, this way apache can write to word press files. (warning: this may make wp vulnerable to apache attacks)

(optional): A good option for a safe work around here: https://serverfault.com/questions/696509/how-do-i-revoke-ownership-of-a-directory-from-apache-service-account-after-an-er



When the instance is ready, connect via web or ssh, just to be sure you are able to follow the “connect” instructions.

Next is setting up security groups (could be done before the instance creation too and add it during the initial creation.
